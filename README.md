# strebo – social trend board ❤

## team
We are Aram Parsegyan, Fabian Retkowski and David Schreck and we are students of Applied Computer Science at the Cooperative State University in Karlsruhe.

This GitHub repository is created for the project that we will be working on in our Software Engineering course, in our third and fourth semester.
