## team
We are Aram Parsegyan, Fabian Retkowski and David Schreck and we are students of Applied Computer Science at the Cooperative State University in Karlsruhe.

This GitHub repository is created for the project that we will be working on in our Software Engineering course, in our third and fourth semester.

## vision

Have you ever wished of a web-based application where you can see ALL the trendy stuff and all your relevant content from different social-media platforms at a glance?

Your journey will end here!

strebo is the project that we will work on, while we are in our third and fourth semester at the Cooperative State University in Karlsruhe.

Enjoy!
